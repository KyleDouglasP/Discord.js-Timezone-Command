# Discord.js-Timezone-Command
Discord.js command framework that allows a user to quickly check the time in various timezones

This command will only work in the framework of a modern discord.js v14 setup, hosted with node.js placed into your command folder.

If you are looking to get started, you can find a good template for this at https://github.com/MericcaN41/discordjs-v14-template-ts.
